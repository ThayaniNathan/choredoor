    <h1> Introduction Of Sudoku</h1>

    <div class="para" >
<p> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Sudoku is a puzzle that has enjoyed worldwide popularity since 2005. To solve a Sudoku puzzle, one needs to use a combination of logic and trial-and-error.
     More math is involved behind the scenes: combinatorics used in counting valid Sudoku grids, group theory used to describe 
     ideas of when two grids are equivalent, and computational complexity with regards to solving Sudokus.</p>
     <br>
     <br>
<p> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;The game in its current form was invented by American Howard Garns in 1979 and published by Dell Magazines as "Numbers in Place." In 1984, Maki Kaji of Japan 
    published it in the magazine of his puzzle company Nikoli. He gave the game its modern name of Sudoku, which means "Single Numbers.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
   <p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; " The puzzle became popular in Japan and was discovered there by New Zealander Wayne Gould, who then wrote a computer program 
    that would generate Sudokus. He was able to get some puzzles printed in the London newspaper The Times beginning in 2004. Soon after, 
    Sudoku-fever swept England. The puzzle finally became popular in the U.S. in 2005. It has become a regular feature in many newspapers and magazines and is 
    enjoyed by people all over the globe.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
<p> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;The standard version of Sudoku consists of a 9×9 square grid containing 81 cells. The grid is subdivided into nine 3×3 blocks. 
    Some of the 81 cells are filled in with numbers from the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. These filled-in cells are called givens. 
    The goal is to fill in the whole grid using the nine digits so that each row, each column, and each block contains each number 
    exactly once. We call this constraint on the rows, columns, and blocks the One Rule.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
<p> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;The above-described puzzle is called a Sudoku of rank 3. A Sudoku of rank n is an n2×n2 square grid, subdivided into n2 blocks,
     each of size n×n. The numbers used to fill the grid in are 1, 2, 3, ..., n2, and the One Rule still applies.</p>
     <br>
     <br>
<p> Here is an example of a Sudoku puzzle and its solution:</p>

                 <p> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;What most people don’t know is that Sudoku is not a mathematical game. It requires absolutely no 
                     arithmetic skills, but it does require logical reasoning. As you learn to arrange the numbers correctly,
                      your logical thinking skills improve. </p>

            <div class="p1">
                <p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Logical thinking and memory go hand-in-hand. As your logical thinking improves, you will start to 
                    remember specific strategies and recall what worked in previous Sudoku puzzles. This can be used to remember
                     and recall things in other areas of life. Don’t be surprised if you find yourself thinking about the game you just
                      finished this morning and remember what you did to solve the problem.</p>

            <div class="p1">
                <p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Medical professionals will tell you that there isn’t really anything that can prevent Alzheimer’s 
                    and that’s most probably true. However, they will also tell you that there are certain things that a person
                     can do to slow down the process of memory loss, which is what Alzheimer’s disease is all about. <br>
                     <br>
                     &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;What slows down Alzheimer’s memory loss? Keeping blood pressure regulated, daily exercise, memory training 
                     exercises like puzzles are the key to slowing down the negative impact of Alzheimer’s. Strengthening the brain is
                      an integral part of Alzheimer’s treatment, and Sudoku is a great game to assist in the process.</p>

                <p> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Find that you’re not able to “think on your feet” or err before answering questions and organizing your thoughts? 
                    Play Sudoku for a few weeks, and all of that could change. Because Sudoku is a game that engages the brain throughout
                     the puzzle-solving process, it helps to teach the brain to think quicker. The more you play it, the quicker your 
                     thinking skills will be.</p>

                <p> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;If you have ever watched someone playing Sudoku, you will notice that they are entirely absorbed in the process.
                     You won’t be able to solve a Sudoku puzzle if you are distracted by everything going on around you. Because of this,
                      puzzlers who enjoy the game very quickly learn to focus their concentration on what they are doing in that very moment. 
                      This skill can be used in other areas of life where concentration and focus are required. </p>

                <p> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Of course, completing any difficult puzzle is an accomplishment, but what’s so important about that? 
                    Having a sense of accomplishment is the number one element that keeps a person feeling motivated and positive. <br>
                    <br>
                    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;If someone feels as if they never accomplish or achieve anything, chances are that they will start to feel depressed
                     and unmotivated. Are you feeling a bit like this yourself? Grab a game or 2 of Sudoku – that may soon change.</p>

            <li> Regular Sudoku playing minimizes the negative impact of Dementia.</li>

            <div class="p1">
                <p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Playing mental games and exercises may not stop Dementia in its tracks when you already have it, 
                    but studies have shown that brain exercise throughout life can help to build a healthy reserve of brain
                     cells and connections. This can minimize the risk of Dementia. <br>
                     <br>
                     &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;That being said, brain exercise is excellent for building reserves, which may compensate for damage 
                     that is caused by diseases such as Dementia. Start playing Sudoku early on in life to ensure that your 
                     brain is getting the workout it needs. </p>

                     Feel anxiety rising before a big meeting or attending a social gathering? Mental puzzles, like Sudoku, can help to
                      calm the mind and keep stress and anxiety at bay. <br>
                      <br>
                      &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Giving your brain/mind something else to focus on, other than the reason you are stressing/anxious, can help you 
                      regain a sense of balance and calm. Not convinced? Try it for yourself the next time you feel stressed or anxious.</p>

                      To solve a Sudoku puzzle, a child must engage in logic and go through a series of trial and error. It’s a great way to

                        Sudoku is used by many people as a healthy form of escapism. Leave your worries and stresses for a few minutes
                         (or hours) and put your focus on Sudoku. It will provide a beneficial escape that helps to get your
                          mindset right before having to tackle your usual stresses and struggles again.

                    <p> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Hobbies aren’t too popular anymore, unfortunately. Most people choose to pass the time in rather unhealthy ways,

                         unhealthy pass-times and do yourself a bit of good while passing the time productively, Sudoku is the answer. 
                         It will keep you occupied and will do your mental capacity good at the same time.</p>

                        You know that song you keep humming and thinking about against your will? That annoying song stuck in your
                         head is called an “ear-worm,” and you can send it on its way by refocusing your brain on something new that 
                         requires full brain engagement. <br>

                     It’s the same for the brain. If the mind is never challenged, chances are that it will become complacent,
                      unhappy, and sometimes even negative.
                    <br>
                <br>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Developing a healthy mindset is much like developing a healthy body. Feed and exercise the brain with Sudoku,

                <p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Ever felt like you need a distraction from the chaos and responsibilities of the day? Some people go outside for a 
                    smoke break while others enjoy a stroll and a cup of coffee. What do you do? Many people have found that taking a 
                    few moments of “rest” from their current challenging task can help them return to it with new found focus and vigor.
